# Update Log - Major Version
- Added groups listing
- Fixed edit amdin groups/add admin groups where groups were missing in sa_groups_servers resulting in premission not found
- Added support for groups , now you can create groups and assign admins to groups
- Added ability to migrate existing admins to group (irreversible)
- Panel now supports both individual admin flag support along with group support (!IMPORTANT - Recommended to use always groups)
- Improved server listing - now does not rely on port open status to list servers, server should be just online. (Rcon/port access is still needed for live actions or to view players.)
- Added player name on edit admin screen
- Fixed setup screen being accessible even after completion of setup.
- Note:Adding permissions to an existing group for new servers will append the new permissions to the existing set, applying for all associated servers
- It is recommended to not use individual flags/perms to add admin
- Be sure to manage admins/groups from panel as its optimized to disallow duplicates and avoid as much as possible console commands to manage admins/groups.
#### TODO - Edit group and Delete Group will be added gradually.
